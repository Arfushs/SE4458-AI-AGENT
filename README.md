# üß† AI-Powered Flight Assistant - FastAPI (SE4458 Final Project)

This is a Python FastAPI project developed as a final assignment for the SE4458 Software Architecture & Design course. It connects to a RESTful Airline Ticketing API and allows users to interact using natural language, powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5.

Users can search for flights, buy tickets, and check in to their flights. The backend parses user intent from plain English and dynamically authenticates with the Airline API. A lightweight HTML/JavaScript frontend is included for testing the assistant.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python 3.11  
- FastAPI + HTTPX  
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 API  
- Airline API (.NET 8)  
- `python-dotenv` for environment variables  
- HTML + JavaScript frontend interface  

---

## üîê Authentication

All requests to the Airline API require a valid token, which expires frequently. This assistant performs dynamic login using `/Auth/login` at runtime and attaches the token to all subsequent API requests. Credentials are stored in a `.env` file:

```

OPENAI\_API\_KEY=sk-...
AIRLINE\_API\_URL=[https://airline-api-xxxxx.azurewebsites.net/api/v1](https://airline-api-xxxxx.azurewebsites.net/api/v1)
AIRLINE\_USERNAME=admin
AIRLINE\_PASSWORD=admin123

````

## üß† Intent Recognition with OpenAI

The assistant uses GPT-3.5 to extract structured intent from a free-form message. The supported intents are:

- `QueryFlight`  
- `BuyTicket`  
- `CheckIn`

Example message:  
> "Are there flights from Istanbul to Ankara on May 20?"

Extracted JSON:
```json
{
  "intent": "QueryFlight",
  "airportFrom": "Istanbul",
  "airportTo": "Ankara",
  "date": "2025-05-20"
}
````

## üí¨ Example Interactions

**Query a flight**

```json
{
  "message": "Are there flights from Istanbul to Ankara on May 20?"
}
```

**Buy a ticket**

```json
{
  "message": "I want to buy a ticket for flight FL-ABC123. My name is John Doe."
}
```

**Check in**

```json
{
  "message": "I'd like to check in. My ticket ID is TK-999XYZ."
}
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Inside the `backend` folder, create a `.env` file** and configure it as shown:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
AIRLINE_API_URL=https://airline-api-xxxxx.azurewebsites.net/api/v1
AIRLINE_USERNAME=admin
AIRLINE_PASSWORD=admin123
```

3. **Set up the virtual environment**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

4. **Open browser at** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

5. **Frontend usage**: open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

## üìù Notes

This project demonstrates how AI can be used to parse human language and integrate with microservice-based systems. It combines NLP, REST APIs, and a service-oriented backend into a unified assistant that bridges the gap between user input and business logic.
